One of our customers plans to set up a utility for managing its rooms
which becomes too complex during COVID.
Its premises contain a total of 4 rooms and serve 100 employees on site.
per week.
➔ A room has a capacity in number of places, a name.
➔ A room is reserved per 1 hour slot and is reserved from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.
days except weekends.
➔ Only consider the peak hours of the style: 8:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. for the sake of
simplicity. When a room is reserved, no one else can access it
or book it in turn on the same time slot.
➔ For COVID restrictions, a room must be free 1 hour before its next
reservation to allow cleaners to disinfect the
local.
➔ A room must contain only 70% of its initial capacity.
➔ All rooms do not necessarily contain all the tools to
attend all meetings.
There are 4 types of meeting:
• Videoconferences (VC) with partners that require a screen, a
octopus and a webcam;
• Sharing and Case Study (SPEC) sessions require just one
picture
• Simple meetings (RS) between colleagues on sites require
just a room whose capacity is beyond 3 places;
• Coupled meetings (RC) between colleagues on site and working remotely
require a board, a screen and an octopus.
Propose to employees the best room to hold their meeting for this
morning depending on:
• Number of persons
• Type of meeting
• Resources available from the schedule.
